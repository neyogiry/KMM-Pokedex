This repository contains a Kotlin Multiplatform project to help you learn about multi-platform development.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to see the application for different platforms, check out the [iOS](https://github.com/neyogiry/iOS-Pokedex) | [Android](https://github.com/neyogiry/Android-Pokedex) | [Flutter](https://github.com/neyogiry/Flutter-Pokedex) repositories.

### Status: üöß In progress
Pokedex is still in under development, and some features are not yet implemented.

## Project structure
The Kotlin Multiplatform project includes three modules:
- ***shared*** is a Kotlin module that contains the logic common for both Android and iOS applications ‚Äì the code I share between platforms. It uses Gradle as the build system to help automate the build process.
- ***composeApp*** is a Kotlin module that builds into an Android application. It uses Gradle as the build system. The composeApp module depends on and uses the shared module as a regular Android library.
- ***iosApp*** is an Xcode project that builds into an iOS application. It depends on and uses the shared module as an iOS framework. The shared module can be used as a regular framework or as a CocoaPods dependency.

## Requirements
Kotlin: 2.0.10 <br>
Android Gradle Plugin: 8.2.2 <br>

## API

These sample Pokedex apps use [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).<br>
This is a full RESTful API linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pok√©mon main game series.
